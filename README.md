#  Blackjack Object Oriented Programming

Playing Blackjack is simple; attempt to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible without going over 21. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install colorama and figlet.

```bash
pip install colorama, figlet
```

## How to Play
After starting the program, begin by entering any key to continue. Cards are represented with their value and suit (6 of spades - '6s', 10 of hearts - '10h). Face cards display a letter and a value (King of clubs - 'Kc', Queen of diamonds - 'Qd). 

After receiving your cards, decide whether you want to 'hit' or 'hold'. Selecting 'hit' will add another randomly selected card to your deck. Selecting 'hold' will then let the dealer make the same decisions. After both user and dealer have made their decisions, the closest one to 21 wins the round (unless they're tied - then the dealer wins).
